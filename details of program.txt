This is a detail file about the working of the virtual dice roller.
this program starts with a home page. i.e. welcome page.
the main game function works with  RANDOM function to generate the number of times the dice will roll.
then again with RANDOM the program decides the number on the dice..
For further development the plan is to same the outputs in a file with user name.
thats all......
